# AI vs World's Hardest Game!

This is a project aiming to train AIs to play (and successfully complete) levels in the World's Hardest Game using NEAT.
This project was inspired by Code Bullet's video on WHG and NEAT where he trained a series of vectors to play the game. While that approach is effective for searching for the solution to a single level, it does not generalize well to new levels. 

In comparison, this project uses NEAT to train neural networks to play the game, which allows them to potentially learn actions (such as dodging balls and locating food) that generalize to all levels.
